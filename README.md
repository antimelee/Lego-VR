VR Barcharts

A basic bar chart builder using a csv reader. Used for a Research project and currently limited in it's capabilities. Made with no intention of building an executable, since changing values at runtime was a requirment. Therefore it conisists of multiple scenes for different scenarios for easy switching during the study.

Currently using Unity 2018.2 and made to work with the HTC Vive, also works with Windows Mixed Reality.

Main features:
-3 different sizes of Bar Charts
-3 tools: a drawing tool, a highlighting tool, and a filtering tool

!!!WARNING!!!
There's a lot of magic numbers and bad coding since this project began as my first serious foray into Unity. I hope to fix these soon so that maybe someone else can atleast use portions of my work. Also requires a general clean-up of files.
